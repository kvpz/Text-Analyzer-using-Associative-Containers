~~~ 7/12/15 ~~~
-Note difference in foaa.cpp and foaa+.cpp (respectively):
   <         aa[key] = data;
   <         // aa[key] += data;
   ---
   >         // aa[key] = data;
   >            aa[key] += data;

-Studying the concept of RBLLT with area51 file frbllt_*.x

~~~ 8/1/15 ~~~
-Major difference in wordify.cpp. All strings are cleaned as requested.
-tiny.txt.com is the same as com.6 in proj4.
-Making changes to wordbench2.cpp after making drastic improvements to the one
in proj4.
-BIG PROBLEM: calling RGet from Get and sending root_ as the first parameter
does pass the Node pointer root_ into RGet. I am able to print root_ data in
Get() before calling RGet(), but I cannot print the data in RGet after passing
it.  

~~~ 8/2/15 ~~~
- RGet works perfectly when ReadText is executed. Results were compared with
proj4 implementation of wordbench using english.txt.

~~~ 8/5/15 ~~~
Testing RInsert calling rehash in foaa.x. Note that the calls to RInsert from
CopyNode class will mostly have a non null node in the first parameter when
newroot_ in CopyNode is pointing to a node with children.

=> The storing of elements works fine in wordbench so operator[] works and thus
RGet works as well. Testing with foaa.cpp though... made a change to the second
if statement in RGet():  !(nptr->lchild_ != 0 && nptr->lchild_->IsRed()). I
negated the conditional statement and did not negate the second argument only.

~~~ 2/28/16 ~~~
=> All include preprocessor directories have been made local relative to the project
(all within ./includes). Changes to the makefile followed to accommodate changes.

=> Linking errors appeared, one being: main.o:(.xdata+0x8): undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'
This was resolved by appending '-lstdc++' at the end of each linking command found in
wb2.x, main.o, wordbench2.o, and xstring.o. See makefile. The reason for this issue is
still unknown; not an issue when compiling in Linux environment (only cygwin64). For more info see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6045809/problem-with-g-and-undefined-reference-to-gxx-personality-v0

==> The above issue with the '__gxx_personality_v0' error occurred again. I found the problem to
be with the include directives. I modified the include preprocessor directives for all project files.
Quoatations("") surrounding the source file name is preferred if the file is within the same folder (roughly
speaking).
